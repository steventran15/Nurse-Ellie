# Nurse Ellie
More than a Medication Reminder Mobile Application

## About the Application
NurseEllie's vision is to help patients adhere to their medication regimen, and for health professionals to understand their patient’s feedback using technology. Its purpose is to close the health literacy disparity for at-risk individuals and reduce the barriers to developing a good patient-physician relationship. Features of the app will be designed to be user friendly, easy to learn, accessible, and promotes health literacy.  

## How It Works 
Register an account to use medication tracking and reminder features. Health professionals can register a professional account and connect with their patients to track patient medication intake and receive feedback in the form of a symptom checklist
